After analyzing the trends of birth rates, it's evident that the rate of births is highest on Tuesdays, while
Sundays consistently record the lowest rate of births. Additionally, it's notable that the rate of births is 
generally higher on working days compared to weekends. This trend suggests a correlation between the timing of 
births and the days of the week, with more births occurring during weekdays, possibly influenced by factors such
as scheduled inductions or elective procedures, as well as the availability of medical staff during standard 
working hours.

Furthermore, this trend holds true for both male and female childbirth, indicating that the pattern of higher 
birth rates on weekdays is consistent across genders. This observation highlights the uniformity of the trend 
and suggests that external factors affecting birth timing apply equally to both male and female births.
