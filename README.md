# **AICP Data Analysis Internship**

# Internship Work â€“ Data Analysis and Dashboards

This repo has the work I did during my 6-week internship. Each folder is for one week and shows the progress step by step.

- Week 1 starts with Python basics and using libraries like NumPy and Pandas for simple math and data handling.  
- In the next weeks I moved on to data visualization using Matplotlib, Seaborn and other plotting libraries.  
- Later weeks cover data cleaning and building simple dashboards with Streamlit and Django.  
- The final week has a complete project that brings together everything I learned, with data cleaning, analysis, visualization and a working dashboard.

During the internship I also worked with larger datasets, cleaned and pre-processed 40k+ records, improved feature selection through EDA, and automated preprocessing pipelines in Python that were linked with Django dashboards.

This repo shows the full journey from basics to a complete project. It can be helpful for anyone starting with Python, data analysis, or dashboard building.
